# 🌱 Greenhouse Gas Emission Forecasting

This project is developed as part of the **AICTE – Green AI Internship (June 2025 Cycle)**.  
The objective is to forecast greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in various industries using real-world supply chain data.

---

## 📌 Project Objective

To analyze and predict **carbon dioxide (CO₂)** emissions using time series forecasting models, based on supply chain emissions data from US industries between 2010–2016.
